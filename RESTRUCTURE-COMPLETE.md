# 🎉 Platform Restructure Complete!

## What Changed

Your app has been restructured into a professional recruiting platform with a clear separation between the landing page and the main application.

---

## 📍 New Page Structure

### **Home Page** (`/`)
- Beautiful gradient landing page with hero section
- Shows 3 feature cards (Boolean Search, Analytics, Requisitions)
- Auto-redirects signed-in users to `/dashboard`
- Sign In/Sign Up button for new users

### **Dashboard Page** (`/dashboard`)
**All-in-one recruiting workspace with 4 main sections (in order):**

1. **📊 Recruiting Analytics** (Top Priority - See metrics first!)
   - **KPI Cards**: Time to Fill, Open Requisitions, Offer Acceptance Rate, Total Candidates
   - Quick overview of your recruiting performance

2. **📋 Requisition Management** (Manage what you're hiring for)
   - Table showing all requisitions with filters
   - Columns: Position, Hiring Manager, Department, Location, Priority, Status, **Created Date**, **Target Start**, **Hire Date**
   - "+ Add Requisition" button

3. **🔍 Boolean Search Builder** (Find candidates for your requisitions)
   - Platform tabs (LinkedIn, GitHub, Stack Overflow, etc.)
   - Search form with role, include, exclude, location
   - "Open in Google/Bing" buttons
   - Save/load searches functionality

4. **📈 Recruiting Funnel** (Track candidate progression)
   - Visual pipeline showing candidate movement through stages
   - Conversion rates between stages

---

## 🔧 Database Migration Required

**You need to run this SQL in Supabase to add the hire_date column:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.requisitions
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS hire_date date;
```

This adds the **Hire Date** field to track when positions are actually filled.

## 🎨 What Users Will Experience

### **Not Signed In:**
1. Visit `http://localhost:3000`
2. See beautiful landing page with features
3. Click "Sign In / Sign Up"
4. Enter email → receive magic link
5. Click link → redirected to `/dashboard`

### **Signed In:**
1. Visit `http://localhost:3000` → auto-redirect to `/dashboard`
2. See entire platform in one view:
   - Build Boolean searches at the top
   - View KPIs and funnel metrics
   - Manage requisitions at the bottom
3. Work in a single, cohesive workspace

---

## ✅ Next Steps

### 1. Run the Database Migration
Go to **Supabase SQL Editor** and run:
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.requisitions
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS hire_date date;
```

### 2. Test the Application
1. **Sign out** if you're currently signed in
2. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
3. See the new landing page
4. Click **"Sign In / Sign Up"**
5. Check your email and click the magic link
6. You'll be redirected to `/dashboard` with all features in one place

### 3. Test the Features (Following the Workflow)
1. **View Analytics** - See your KPIs at the top (currently 0 until you add data)
2. **Add a Requisition** - Click "+ Add Requisition" and fill in the form
3. **Use Boolean Search** - Search for candidates matching your requisition (e.g., "Software Engineer" with "React")
4. **View Funnel** - Check candidate progression through hiring stages

The new layout follows your natural workflow:
- 📊 **See metrics** → 📋 **Manage jobs** → 🔍 **Find candidates** → 📈 **Track progress**
