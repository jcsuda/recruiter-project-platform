# LinkedIn "Open to Work" Feature

## What's New

Added a **LinkedIn Status** field to the Boolean Search Builder that allows you to filter LinkedIn profiles by their status hashtags.

---

## 📋 New Field (LinkedIn Only)

### **LinkedIn Status**
A dropdown with three options:

1. **— (None)** - No status filter
2. **#OpenToWork** - Find people actively seeking opportunities
3. **#Hiring** - Find people who are actively hiring

---

## 🔍 How It Works

### Example Search:
**Platform:** LinkedIn  
**Role:** Software Engineer  
**Include:** React, TypeScript  
**Location:** San Francisco  
**LinkedIn Status:** #OpenToWork  

**Generated Query:**
```
site:linkedin.com/in ("Software Engineer") AND ("React" AND "TypeScript") AND "San Francisco" #OpenToWork
```

This will find LinkedIn profiles of Software Engineers in San Francisco with React and TypeScript skills who have the **#OpenToWork** badge on their profile.

## 💡 Use Cases
