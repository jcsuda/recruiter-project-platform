**After:** Each stage has its own unique, beautiful color

This makes it **instantly clear** where candidates are in the pipeline and helps identify bottlenecks at a glance.

- **Wide blue bar** at top = Lots of applications (good!)
- **Narrowing through colors** = Natural funnel progression
- **Green bar at bottom** = Successful hires (the goal!)
- **Conversion rates** show drop-off between stages
